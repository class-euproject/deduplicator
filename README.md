# class-aggregator

This branch has been developed by BSC based from the source code found in the master branch and provided by Universit√† di Modena e Reggio Emilia. The code has been slightly modified in order to be adapted and integrated with the COMPSs workflow, and to do so, a binding between C++ and Python has been introduced in `src/modules.cpp`.

class-aggregator provides the software to deduplicate and aggregate the edge information of a smart city in the context of the European Project CLASS (H2020, G.A. 780622)
